This repository contains code for controlling a RoboClaw wirelessly with a web interface. It builds off of the [previous Application Note](https://resources.basicmicro.com/simple-wireless-control-of-roboclaw-with-the-esp8266/) by adding AJAX functionality to read and display data from the motor controller. The Application Note that accompanies this code can be [found here](https://resources.basicmicro.com/esp8266-advanced-control-of-roboclaw/).
